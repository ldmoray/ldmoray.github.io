So I've begun working on a project with a friend to be built in the MEAN stack. Full stack Javascript developer, here I come. I mean, yes, they're going to be handling most of the front end work, because I know next to nothing about it, but regardless: full stack. Normally, I program on a Macbook Pro, and only do some minor touchups on my Windows machine when I'm in a bind, but I decided to program on that instead. Cygwin, which I frequently use, and Node.js apparently do not get along. Luckily, after installing Mongo, Node (v5, of course), Express.js, and Angular, I thought I was good. It all seemed to work in my cygwin terminal. I could initiate an Express.js project, and use
`npm install` with no problem. Only I forgot some things. 

Obviously I want to do my CSS in Sass, so that means installing Ruby and the Sass interpreter.
And of course I need to decide if I want grunt or gulp (great. I don't deal with picking automation tools enough at work). And Bower! Can't forget Bower! Sure, I don't really know what it's for, but I need it. And Mongoose. Because Mongo is non-relational. And we want to be able to create models and relations between our models. With a non-relational database. Genius. So, after I set all this up, I learn there's a thing in npm that lets you do all this in half the time. Well then, to the MEAN CLI!

Tomorrow we'll see if I can actually convince myself to build a basic model for the first part of my database schema, and a form for posting. Maybe I'll even host it somewhere.
